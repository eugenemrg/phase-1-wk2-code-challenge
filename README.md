# PHASE 1 - WEEK 2: CODE CHALLENGE

# Flataculties

An app where you can vote for the cutest animal.

The app can:
- Retrieve the character data using a GET request to the '/characters' endpoint
- List animal names from the retrieved character data
- Show details of clicked animalâ€™s name i.e. image and number of votes
- Add number of votes for each animal and display number of votes in the details
- Reset the votes back to 0 using the reset button for list or for single animal
- Add new animals using form
